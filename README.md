This project is for my Friend George's homestay property, he granted me permission to open source it for future utilization for other developers/business.

Feel free to add features here.

#Intuitive Design
I planned to make this project neat and clean
so I went on to use the basic colors like grey,
black and white. This gives a minimalist style
and feels to the user that matches with the
hotel theme and also provides a clear image of
the app. And the carousel is introduced to
provide a smooth seamless user interface.

#Interactive Gallery View With Lazy loading Technique
I wanted to make sure that the user have a
seamless experience while using the website.
So I added a lazy loading technique to load
the images so the image will be loaded after the
user scrolled to the particular image slide.

#Increase in booking
With the deployment of the app, the site
experience more booking during the weekend
and also on weekdays. And this provides the hotel
with the online presence that enables to
connect with young age group people.


## Below are the Scripts that you can use

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
